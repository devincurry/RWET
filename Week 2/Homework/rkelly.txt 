I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt 
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt) 
Winkin' her eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt) 
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt) 
And when she's wit her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt) 
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Now swear to tell the truth 
And the whole truth When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to 
Rollin like I supposed to Shinin' like I supposed to 
In the club, fuckin' wit' honeys like I supposed to 
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club 
Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club 
And wonder why all these playas tryin' to holla at her 
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm goin' holla at her 
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall 
If I could man I probably would flirt wit all y'all 
Yeah, yeah homie u say she ya girlfriend 
But when I step up to her I'm be like cousin 
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the Chi 
And plus we got them player-ette flirters in the Chi 
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch '
Cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)
Hey homie, if you ain't gettin' no money 
You better keep her away from me ya dig
Well if u love ya girl And wanna keep ya girl 
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl 
'Cause I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl 
She winked her eyes on the slide I seen u girl 
Better treat your girl right 
'Cause another man will 
Better eat ya girl like another man will 
'Cause u leave your wife 
And I see ya wife 
That be for real 
How long u think that's finna be ya wife
 Well I'm livin the life You just gettin' it right 
Your old lady look at me 
'Cause you ain't hittin' it right 
She probably used to like u 
'Cause you you the better type 
That's until I came along 
And put some dick in her life 
Wanna see me dance 
I noticed she was checkin' me 
And diggin' the ice 
And if I get that tonight 
Better hit that twice 
I can even make her mine 
If I hit that right 
You know smack that thang 
Sit that right 
Upon that dresser 
Yeah that's right 
Pullin' on her hair 
Like we gettin' in a fight 
Yeah I know it's kinda tight 
But it'll settle just right 
So if yo girl sexy 
And she test me 
Don't be upset g 
'Cause u might catch me 
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt
We playing in my glam in reverse 
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt
When I, when I, when I,when I pull up to club 
All the shawties be like (Damn 28's) 
Then I be like girl u know just who I am (Don't hate) 
See I done fell in love wit a stripper y'all 
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
 And I don't need no help, I got it down pat
 Teddy Paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
 Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town 
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down 
I be like como si llama, lil' mama mi llamo pain, what is yo name 
I'm feelin' yo vibe 
And I'm hopin' you feel the same 
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game 
When I pass by I know exactly what u say 
He's so fly And he's so coo 
Hey shawty (Hey shawty) 
What it do 
He mad 'cause I'm lookin' but I already fucked her 
I got these niggas mad 'cause (I'm a flirt)
It's the remix 
Now if u walk up in the club with a bad chick and she lookin' at me
 Then I'm gon hit 
Man jackin' for chicks 
I tried to quit 
But I'm playa homie 
So I had to hit 
While you buyin' her drinks (In the club)
 Actin' like you (In love) 
Stunnin' like you (All thug) 
We was (Switching numbers) 
She lookin' at you when I walk by 
You turn yo head, she wink her eye 
I can't help if she checkin' for a platinum type of guy 
She be callin' me daddy, and I be callin' her mommy 
She be callin' you Kelly, when yo name is Tommy 
I don't know what y'all be thinkin' 
When you bring 'em round me Let me remind you that I am the king of r&b 
Do you know what that means 
That means if you love yo chick 
Don't bring her to the VIP 
'Cause I might leave wit yo chick 
Just keepin' it real (My nigga) 
It is a playa's feel (My nigga) 
Don't take no bitch to the club when u just met her (My nigga) 
'Cause I'm flirt wit her (Right) 
He gon' flirt wit her (Right) 
And if she lookin' that good shit 
She gon' flirt wit her
